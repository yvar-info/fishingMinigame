# fishingMinigame
My website fishing minigame, 

This is the code for the fishing minigame on my website. I added it here because then people can look at it easier.
This way you can check how I programm with the current tools, I did use chatGPT to help me here and there but most logic and the idea behind the game came from me.
I was inspired to add a fishing minigame because in my opinion all great games have one. So i wanted one for my website.

I spent a few days thinking about controles and gameplay loops. So that even for a small game its fun to play.
I also wanted to make it feel as authentic as possible so instead of a high stress situational game.
I made a low stakes easy to get into and easy to drop fishing game. 

The idea of adding games came to me when i wanted my portofolio website to stand out more.
You can alway show off cool things like data and such, but proofing how good i am at programming by making a few webgames seemed more fun.
And boy was it more fun. thinking about edge cases getting friends and family to test them and learning a bit about game development and sharpening my coding skills.
I do not regret it one bit!

do keep in mind i only currently have a beta version its far from what i want to make, but you need to start small to dream big!
